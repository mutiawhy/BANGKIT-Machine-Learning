## Data, Techniques and Results

The data used in this project was from Kaggle :

Tensorflow was utilized to optimize a linear regression y = Ax + b and  MSE was used as the loss function.

On average, the predicted price is 46.04% more or less than the real price. Need more complex model to predict the data better
